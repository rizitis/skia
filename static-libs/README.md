These libraries are essential building blocks for Skia and related projects. Depending on your application's needs—whether it’s handling advanced text rendering, GPU acceleration, raw image formats, or color management—these libraries can be included or excluded accordingly. For a simple graphics application, you might only need libskia.a, but for more advanced use cases, you may need to include many of the others listed here:

libskparagraph.a

    Purpose: Provides functionality for advanced text layout and paragraph formatting.
    Use Case: Useful for applications that need to render complex text with proper layout (e.g., word wrapping, multi-line support).

libskshaper.a

    Purpose: Text shaping for rendering complex scripts and languages.
    Use Case: Essential for supporting languages that require advanced text shaping (like Arabic, Indic languages, etc.).

libspvtools.a

    Purpose: Tools for processing SPIR-V, a binary intermediate language for shaders.
    Use Case: Useful for graphics applications that require shader compilation and optimization with Vulkan or OpenGL.

libspvtools_reduce.a

    Purpose: A library for reducing SPIR-V shaders.
    Use Case: Used to minimize shaders or remove unnecessary code to improve shader efficiency.

libutils.a

    Purpose: A collection of utility functions for general-purpose use.
    Use Case: Provides basic utilities that assist with other components in Skia or related projects.

libbentleyottmann.a

    Purpose: Implements the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm for computing the intersection of line segments.
    Use Case: Useful for geometric operations and computational geometry tasks like polygon clipping or finding intersections in vector graphics.

libdawn_native_static.a

    Purpose: Native static library for Dawn, a low-level graphics API.
    Use Case: Provides the foundational GPU capabilities for WebGPU. Used in applications requiring modern, high-performance GPU acceleration.

libdng_sdk.a

    Purpose: SDK for handling DNG (Digital Negative) files.
    Use Case: Required for applications that need to handle raw images in DNG format, often used in photography and image processing.

libpiex.a

    Purpose: A library for handling various image formats, such as JPEG and PNG.
    Use Case: Needed for image decoding/encoding operations across multiple formats, useful in applications dealing with image file formats.

libskia.a

    Purpose: The core Skia graphics library.
    Use Case: Provides the core functionality for rendering graphics, including 2D vector graphics, text rendering, and image manipulation.

libskresources.a

    Purpose: Manages Skia resources such as fonts, images, and other assets.
    Use Case: Important for applications that require resource management, including loading and managing graphic assets.

libskunicode_core.a

    Purpose: Core utilities for Unicode text processing.
    Use Case: Essential for working with text in multiple languages, providing Unicode handling capabilities for rendering and manipulation.

libskunicode_icu.a

    Purpose: Unicode and text processing library, using ICU (International Components for Unicode).
    Use Case: Provides advanced support for internationalization and localization, especially in multi-language or global applications.

libspvtools_link.a

    Purpose: A library for linking SPIR-V shaders.
    Use Case: Used for compiling and linking shaders into executable forms in graphics programming with Vulkan.

libspvtools_opt.a

    Purpose: Optimizes SPIR-V shaders.
    Use Case: Used in graphics applications to optimize shader code for better performance.

libsvg.a

    Purpose: Handles Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.
