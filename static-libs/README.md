Whether you need libdng_sdk.a, libpathkit.a, libpiex.a, libskcms.a, and libwuffs.a depends on your specific use case with Skia. Here's a brief explanation of what each of these libraries is typically used for:

    libdng_sdk.a:
        Purpose: This is a static library related to the DNG (Digital Negative) SDK. It is used for handling DNG files, which are a type of raw image format.
        Need: If your application needs to work with DNG files or if Skia’s functionality you’re using relies on this SDK, you’ll need this library. Otherwise, it might not be necessary.

    libpathkit.a:
        Purpose: This library is related to PathKit, which is used for path manipulation and text layout. It is often used in graphics and text rendering.
        Need: If your application involves complex text layout or path operations, this library is important. For basic graphics operations, it might not be essential.

    libpiex.a:
        Purpose: This is a static library for handling various image formats, such as JPEG or PNG.
        Need: If your application needs to support multiple image formats or if Skia relies on this library for image decoding/encoding, you should keep it. Otherwise, it may not be needed for simpler use cases.

    libskcms.a:
        Purpose: This library is for color management. It handles color profiles and conversions.
        Need: If your application requires precise color management (e.g., working with ICC profiles or color transformations), this library is important. For basic graphics tasks, it may not be required.

    libwuffs.a:
        Purpose: Wuffs is a library for decoding and encoding image formats like PNG, JPEG, and more. It's a performant library for handling image formats.
        Need: If your application requires decoding/encoding of various image formats and relies on Wuffs, you’ll need this library. Otherwise, it might not be necessary.
